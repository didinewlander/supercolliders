## A Short Description Of Each Project:
### Console Hangman Game  
A simple game, if you didn't got the chance to play it, that one player, the hinter, picks a word, and the other player needs to guess the word while choosing a letter in each round - if the letter is in the word - the hinter fills up the letters on some writing material (paper, whiteboard... you get the concept), but if the letter is not in the word - the hinter starts to draw a hung stick-figure man, part after part. The harder the game gets - more parts are drawen for each wrong answer. There should also be a option for the guesser guess the entire word, but it'll cost him all the letters that he didn't mention yet   
The game ends if the guesser managed to find all the letters and find the word, or the hinter succesfully hung the stick-figure man.
